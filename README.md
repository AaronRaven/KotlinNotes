# Overview

I have developed a Kotlin program named "KotlinNotes". It is a mini diary. It can store a note name and content of the note. This project is part of my Kotlin and smartphone app development learning journey.

The program utilizes a Do-While loop for error handling and IF statements for logical checks. User choices are managed using WHEN statements. It uses elements of Object Oriantated programming for storing notes, as each note has an ID, Name and content that is stored inside of objects. It also  uses functions to make, view or edit notes. It can also export said data in a text file. Overall, while short, this program is rich in what it Kotlin features.

# Development Environment

I used IntelJ to write this program.

Due to richness of Kotlin, it only uses one library - java.io.File  to create text files.

# Future Work

This program is first step in learning how to make smartphone apps. In the future I will expand it so that users could write a date and better organized conent, and edit everything with more ease.
I will aslo add a graphic user interface and make it work on android apps.
